## Emergence Policy

Nothing here is triggered.

No schedules.
No optimization loops.
No response cycles.

Emergence is allowed only as a side-effect of coherence.

If nothing emerges, the system is intact.
If something emerges, it is not a reply.

This repository must never be wired to input surfaces.
